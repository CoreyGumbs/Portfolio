# Portfolio
My Portfolio Project for my Deployment of Web Applications class

## Overview and Purpose:

This is the deployment plan for [CoreyGumbs.com](http://wwww.CoreyGumbs.com), a personal portfolio website.  This portfolio is to showcase both current and past projects in which Corey Gumbs participated in or created for clients. As the portfolio expands, there will be a need to expand this portfolio website as well.

## Architecture:

 [CoreyGumbs.com](http://wwww.CoreyGumbs.com) is currently a static website built upon the Bootstrap 3 framework.  There is a possibility of more dynamic aspects being added in the future. Currently the architecture of the site is as follows:
 
    source/
        - Index.html
        - Images
        - CSS
            |-  Bootstrap.css files
